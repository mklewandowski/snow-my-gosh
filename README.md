## Voxel Art

Voxel art is created using Magicavoxel. To add new voxel art to the project, do the following:
- create asset model in Magicavoxel
- export model as a .obj file (multiple files are exported, only the .obj file is needed)
- import the .obj model file into Unity
- change the material on the mesh renderer to `voxelMaterial.mat`
- drop the model into a scene (scale and rotation might need to be adjusted)
